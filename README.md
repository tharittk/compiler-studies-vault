# Teaching myself a compiler ðŸ“š
ðŸ‘‹ These are the collection of resources I used to study compilers in my spare time. It is still evolving as I continue to learn.

- [x] [Stanford Compiler](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/stanford-university-compilers)
- [x] [Princeton Compiler](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring18/cos320/)

      These two courses, when combined, serve as an introduction to the compiler.
      The video lectures from Stanford are heavily weighted on the front-end part.
      And since I want to learn LLVM along with compiler theory, I instead did the assignments in the Princeton class.
      It covers more materials from Stanford but lacks video lectures. 6 assignments involve building an ML-like compiler in C++.

  - [x] Lexical analysis with Flex
  - [x] Parsing with Bison
  - [x] Code generation using LLVM IR Builder (this is fun !)
  - [x] Instrumenting code with LLVM Pass (Edge and Block Profiler)
  - [x] SuperBlock Formation

- [x] Building the LiveOak-3 (Java-like) programming language
      
      As a part of my graduate coursework, I built an object-oriented language and got
      a chance to hand-code an LL(1) Recursive Descent Parser - oh, it was beautiful once done (but I cannot share !).
      Also, code generation with Stack Machine was a pain in debugging and made me appreciate LLVM IR Builder.
      
- [x] Engineering a Compiler - I read this back-to-back and found that I couldn't get a good grasp of compiler optimization and back-end development without lectures.

# Current 
      The compiler optimization and backend are cool - currently, this is just my feeling. 
      I'm going to validate that.
      
- [ ] [Compiler Optimization - Sorav, Bansal - IIT Delhi](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf3ZkSCyj1tdEbsKimjbzI67HtSqY_m84)
    
    I like his teaching style. And the playlist is comprehensive.
- [ ] [Compiler Optimization by U of Toronto](https://uoft-ecosystem.github.io/CSCD70/) | [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0qj8UdnOw30ZGMcM6DwvM1J2tttyy_D6)
      
    This course has assignments using LLVM covering
  -  [ ] LLVM Pass
  -  [ ] Dataflow Analysis framework
  -  [ ] Loop-Invariant Code motion
  
  I believe it is modeled after the course from Carnegie Mellon (assignments are pretty much the same). I will do the assignments, but prefer to have the lecture from IIT (I like the pace there more).

- [ ] [Cornell CS6120](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2025sp/schedule/)
    This one is more like a graduate-level seminar + lectures. I plan to do this last as it involves exploring with paper. But the guy teaching it looks cool.
# Books
Here are the books I have beside me
